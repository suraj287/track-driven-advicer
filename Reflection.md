## Top 5 Learnings

1. **OAuth2 (Authorization Code Flow)** – Gained practical experience implementing secure login with Spotify.
2. **Access Token Management** – Understood how to exchange and use tokens to access user data.
3. **API Integration** – Worked with Spotify’s `/me/top/tracks` to pull user-specific content.
4. **Async/Await & Error Handling** – Improved flow control and reliability in API-heavy backend apps.

##  Pitfalls & Improvements

- Didn’t implement **refresh token flow** (tokens expire after 1 hour).
- Needed better logging & error visibility during early OAuth debugging.

##  Future Product Enhancements

2. **Share your top songs** – Create a cool image of your top 5 tracks that you can post on social media.

3. **Compare music with friends** – Let users see how similar their music taste is to their friends'.
